I have a [Notion app](https://www.notion.so/Release-Tracker-5f967c3b1c30445b857ad3093c96b282?pvs=4) that tracks new album releases. I use this to keep track of what I've listened too, pre-ordered, and downloaded, and also to create my albums-of-the-year (AOTY) list at the end of the year.

Most of my records come from Bandcamp or Spotify, so this script allows me to import them directly without copy-pasting a lot of info.

```bash
notion-import-record bandcamp https://awakebutstillinbed.bandcamp.com/album/chaos-takes-the-wheel-and-i-am-a-passenger https://ashtuesday.bandcamp.com/track/calypso

notion-import-record spotify https://open.spotify.com/album/05PlYzA6iAlIjPclb5dUcb
```
